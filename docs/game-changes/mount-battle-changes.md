# Mount Battle Changes

## EV Training Zones

The first 6 zones of Mount Battle have been converted into specialized EV training areas. All Pokémon in these zones only know the move Memento.

!!! warning "Berry Note"
    Each zone's Pokémon hold the EV-lowering berry corresponding to the EV they give (Except Pomeg Berry).
    However, in both vanilla and this rom hack, these berries do not work.

### Zone Layout

| Zone | EV Trained |
|------|------------|
| Zone 1 | Special Defense |
| Zone 2 | Defense |
| Zone 3 | Speed |
| Zone 4 | Special Attack |
| Zone 5 | Attack |
| Zone 6 | HP |

## Challenge Zones

Zones 7-10 have been significantly enhanced and now feature the most challenging battles in the game.

!!! tip "Training Strategy"
    You can efficiently EV train your Pokémon by defeating multiple Pokémon in the corresponding zones. Since they only know Memento, they won't be able to damage your Pokémon, making training safer and easier.
