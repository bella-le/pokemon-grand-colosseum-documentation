# Pokemon Grand Colosseum Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive information about Pokemon Grand Colosseum, including game changes, gameplay tips, and detailed Pokemon data.

[Pokemon Grand Colosseum](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4623-pokemon-grand-colosseum/) is a rom hack of Pokemon Colosseum by [KyaColosseum](https://x.com/KyaColosseum). Please support KyaColosseum by following them on their socials and keeping up with their Twitter or streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kyacolosseum)!

I (7decibel, the compiler of these docs) am *not* the original developer of Grand Colosseum and all documentation was included in the original release in .txt files which I have converted into this readable website.
